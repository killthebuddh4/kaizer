I cleaned up the code/config a tiny bit and added a README. The very next thing to do is add multi-user support and Stripe integration. I need to pin down exactly what the next feature set is. So I think there's 2 phases for multi-user:

#### phase 1, no payments implemented

1. sign up, cancel
2. basic crud
   1. list logs
   2. download log
   3. delete log
3. streaming download

#### phase 2, add stripe support

1. free tier, cheap tier, "call me" tier
2. multiple backend phone numbers

Multiple backend phone numbers is useful because there's a tradeoff between our "zero friction" goal and programmability. When a user calls, you can prompt them with a bunch of controls or you can let them just start talking. I want to err really really heavily on the frictionless side. So, the way you can add a modicum of UI-side programmability is by having users call different numbers.

A few things I need to think a tiny bit about,

- production alerting
- support (Discord? Twitter? GitHub Issues?)

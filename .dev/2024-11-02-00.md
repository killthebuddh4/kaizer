I settled on AWS AppRunner for hosting. It looks like the simplest possible way to do automated deployments. It's basically git push + build + run + a bunch of free, minimal instrumentation like logging and monitoring, maybe even autoscaling. There's a couple issues I've seen that would force me to pick a different service if I ever actually went into production. The biggest one is, as far as I can tell, there's no way to manually interven in the build steps. For example, I can't cancel a build that I know is going to fail because I screwed something up, I have to wait for the build to fail (and the build process seems to be quite slow).

At the moment, there's a "hello, world!" running at some AWS-provided public domain. Next, I want to

1. Make sure redeploys happen automatically on `git push`.
2. Make sure the build system is picking up the config in `apprunner.yaml`
3. Upgrade the `hello, world` to the Twilio Voice version of `hello, world`.

My current solution for prod/dev + Twilio is to have 2 Twilio numbers, one for each env. The prod number is configured with the production webhook, the dev number is configured with the dev webhook. The dev webhook is a stable public dns name I got from ngrok, which is super convenient!

The s3 upload config and code is also working, but it's not ready for prod/dev. 

The very next step is to solve logging and auth.
